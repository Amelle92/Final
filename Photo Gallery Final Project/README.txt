I feel that for working alone, I have accomplished quite a lot. I did not use any external libraries
besides jquery. Everything was written from scratch by me using HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, PHP, and JSON.
I focused a lot on making the gallery look and feel nice. You may notice that the page never reshreshed and
everything is updated dynamically using javascript. Although I wasn't able to fulfill every feature listed,
I believe the quality of my implementation makes up for it.
